	<H1>Basketball</H1>

	<p1> Basketball, Ever since i was little, has always been a huge part of my everyday life. It has consumed a majority of my time all the way up until now. Ive played for serveal different AAU basketball teams and have travled all over the country doing so. I played varsity for my highschool basketball team all four years and i have nothing but positive things to say about my experience. My favorite basketball player is LeBron James and i am looking foward to seeing if the Cavaliers make the NBA finals this year.</p1>
